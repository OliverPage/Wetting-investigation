# Wetting-investigation
Third year computational lab, code used to model the wetting transition.

The file titled "Problem12.py" contains Python 3 code for problems 8-12 inclusive. 
This means it can be used to numerically calulate equilibrium densities, plot 2D density maps, 1D density vs distance plots, and adsorption plots.

The file titled "Problem13.py" contains Pyhton 3 code for problem 13. 
It plots the evolution of a system of fluids next to a surface.
