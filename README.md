# Wetting-investigation
Third year computational lab, code used to model the wetting transition.

The file titled "Problem12.py" contains Python 3 code for problems 8-12 inclusive. 
This means it can be used to numerically calulate equilibrium densities, plot 2D density maps, 1D density vs distance plots, and adsorption plots.

The file titled "Problem13.py" contains Pyhton 3 code for problem 13. 
It plots the evolution of a system of fluids next to a surface. 

βε_w Increase.gif shows how the droplet changes as the value of βε_w is increased, in steps of 0.4, from 0.0 to 8.0.

Droplet_Iterations.gif shows show the final state of the droplet changes after N iterations, each frame corresponds to the final state where the number of iterations has been increased from 0 in the first frame to 500 in tha final frame. This used βε_w = 2, μ/ε = -2.53.
